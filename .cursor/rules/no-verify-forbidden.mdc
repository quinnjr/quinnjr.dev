# Never Use --no-verify Flag

## Rule
**NEVER use `--no-verify` flag with any git commands.**

## Rationale
The `--no-verify` flag bypasses:
- Pre-commit hooks (linting, formatting, tests)
- Pre-push hooks (additional validation)
- Commit message validation
- Security checks

These hooks are essential for maintaining code quality and preventing broken code from entering the repository.

## Correct Usage

### ❌ WRONG - Never do this:
```bash
git push --no-verify
git commit --no-verify
git push origin main --no-verify
```

### ✅ CORRECT - Always let hooks run:
```bash
git push
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main
```

## What to Do Instead

If hooks are failing:
1. **Fix the actual issue** - Don't bypass validation
2. **Review the error messages** - They indicate real problems
3. **Run commands locally** - `pnpm lint:fix`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm format`
4. **Only commit when all checks pass**

## Exceptions
There are **NO exceptions** to this rule. If you need to bypass hooks, you must:
1. Explicitly ask the user for permission
2. Explain why it's necessary
3. Get explicit user approval before proceeding

## Why This Matters
- Ensures code quality standards are met
- Prevents broken builds in CI/CD
- Maintains commit message consistency
- Catches issues early before they reach the repository
- Protects against accidentally committing secrets or sensitive data
