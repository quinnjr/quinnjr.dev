# Git Interaction Rules

## Branch Naming
All branches must follow git-flow convention:
- **feature/name**: New features (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`)
- **bugfix/name**: Bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/login-redirect`)
- **hotfix/name**: Critical hotfixes (e.g., `hotfix/security-patch`)
- **release/name**: Release branches (e.g., `release/v2.0.0`)

## Protected Branches
- **Never push directly to `main` or `master`**
- **Never push directly to `develop`**
- Always create a feature/bugfix/hotfix/release branch
- Use pull requests to merge into protected branches

## Commit Practices
- Make small, focused commits
- One logical change per commit
- Write clear commit messages following the commit message format
- Don't commit broken code
- Don't commit commented-out code
- Don't commit debug statements or console.logs (except intentional ones)

## Pull Requests
- Create PRs for all changes to main/develop
- Write descriptive PR titles and descriptions
- Reference related issues in PR description
- Ensure all tests pass before requesting review
- Ensure linting passes before requesting review
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized

## Workflow
1. Create a feature branch from main/develop
2. Make changes and commit frequently
3. Push branch to remote
4. Create pull request
5. Address review feedback
6. Merge after approval

## Pre-commit Checks
Before committing:
- Run linter: `pnpm lint`
- Run tests: `pnpm test:server`
- Format code: `pnpm format`
- Check for console.logs and debug statements
- Verify all files are saved

## Pre-push Checks
Before pushing:
- Ensure all tests pass
- Ensure linting passes
- Ensure code is formatted
- Review commit messages
- Verify branch name follows convention

## Merge Practices
- Use "Squash and merge" for feature branches
- Use "Merge commit" for release branches
- Delete branch after merge
- Update version numbers appropriately

## Conflict Resolution
- Pull latest changes before starting work
- Rebase feature branches before merging
- Resolve conflicts carefully
- Test after resolving conflicts
- Don't force push to shared branches

## Best Practices
- Commit often with meaningful messages
- Keep commits atomic (one logical change)
- Use `.gitignore` appropriately
- Don't commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Review changes with `git diff` before committing
- Use `git status` frequently to track changes
